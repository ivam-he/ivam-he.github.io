I am currently a research fellow at the School of Computing, [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), working under the supervision of Prof. [Xiaokui Xiao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiaoxk/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in June 2025 from the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/), under the guidance of Prof. [Zhewei Wei](https://weizhewei.com/). Between October 2024 and May 2025, I was a visiting student at the Technical University of Munich, where I collaborated with Prof. [Stephan G√ºnnemann](https://www.professoren.tum.de/guennemann-stephan). Prior to my Ph.D., I earned a B.E. degree in Software Engineering from the School of Computer Science at [Central South University](https://www.csu.edu.cn/) in June 2020.


My research focuses on **Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**, particularly leveraging spectral properties to enhance GNN performance and interpretability. I am also exploring **Graph Transformers**, combining attention mechanisms with graph models for more efficient graph-based data processing. Additionally, I am passionate about **AI for Science (AI4Science)**, applying machine learning techniques to accelerate scientific discovery in fields like materials science, biology, and chemistry.
